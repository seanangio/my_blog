Every month the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gives a radio address to listeners. I collected those speeches with `rvest` and created a `shiny` app to allow users to explore different aspects of the corpus, such as word frequencies, sentiment, and TF-IDF. Find the app at the button above or link below:

Related to this project, I also wrote a short post introducing the `tidytext` package found on the [Social Cops blog](https://blog.socialcops.com/technology/data-science/introduction-tidytext-mining/).
