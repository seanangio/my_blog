In support of Lesson 5 of the Social Cops [Introduction to GIS in R](https://socialcops.com/courses/introduction-to-gis-r/) online course, I created a `shiny` app to demonstrate the concept of spatial subsetting using median household income data from the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Find the app at the button above or link below.
