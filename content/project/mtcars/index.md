The final project for the Linear Regression course of the Data Science Specialization on Coursera from Johns Hopkins University is to assess whether cars with a manual transmission have better fuel efficiency than those with an automatic transmission using only linear regression techniques. The report below attempts to quantify this difference using a variety of linear models.
